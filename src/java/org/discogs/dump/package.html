<title>Discogs Dump File Iterators</title>
</head>
<body>
The classes in this package can be used to iterate through <a href="http://discogs.com/data">discogs xml dump files</a>.
These monthly dump files contain artist, release and label information, which can
be iterated through for local persistence (or other reasons).
<p/>
An example of iteration over Artists is:
<pre>
Iterator&lt;Artist&gt; aIter=new ArtistIterator(new File("discogs_20110107_artists.xml.gz"));
for (Artist curr: aIter) {
  System.out.println("Artist:\n"+curr);
  doSomethingWithTheArtist(curr);
}
</pre>
Precalculation is done within the iterator, so progress information is available,
if required.  Precalculation may also be disabled if a couple seconds wait is too long.
