/**
 * A PassVerifier actually verifies a class file; it is instantiated
 * by a Verifier.
 * The verification should conform with a certain pass as described
 * in The Java Virtual Machine Specification, 2nd edition.
 * This book describes four passes. Pass one means loading the
 * class and verifying a few static constraints. Pass two actually
 * verifies some other constraints that could enforce loading in
 * referenced class files. Pass three is the first pass that actually
 * checks constraints in the code array of a method in the class file;
 * it has two parts with the first verifying static constraints and
 * the second part verifying structural constraints (where a data flow
 * analysis is used for). The fourth pass, finally, performs checks
 * that can only be done at run-time.
 * JustIce does not have a run-time pass, but certain constraints that
 * are usually delayed until run-time for performance reasons are also
 * checked during the second part of pass three.
 * PassVerifier instances perform caching.
 * That means, if you really want a new verification run of a certain
 * pass you must use a new instance of a given PassVerifier.
