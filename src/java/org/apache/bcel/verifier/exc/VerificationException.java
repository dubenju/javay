/**
 * Instances of this class are thrown by BCEL's class file verifier "JustIce" when a
 * class file to verify does not pass one of the verification passes 2 or 3.
 * Note that the pass 3 used by "JustIce" involves verification that is usually
 * delayed to pass 4.
 * The name of this class is justified by the Java Virtual Machine Specification, 2nd
 * edition, page 164, 5.4.1 where verification as a part of the linking process is
 * defined to be the verification happening in passes 2 and 3.
