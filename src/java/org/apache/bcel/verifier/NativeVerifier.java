/**
 * The NativeVerifier class implements a main(String[] args) method that's
 * roughly compatible to the one in the Verifier class, but that uses the
 * JVM's internal verifier for its class file verification.
 * This can be used for comparison runs between the JVM-internal verifier
 * and JustIce.
